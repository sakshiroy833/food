<img src="093267200_1581580862-shutterstock_294636281.webp" alt="">
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture and knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic powder, dried oregano, and sugar. Pour in the tomato puree and cook for 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens. Season with salt to taste, then remove from heat and set aside.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Step 3: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C) for about 15-20 minutes, ensuring it's fully heated before baking the pizza.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Step 4: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two portions (for two pizzas). Roll each portion into a circle on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the rolled dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and add your desired toppings (mushrooms, olives, pepperoni, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

            <h3>For the Burger Patties:</h3>
            <h3>1 lb ground beef (or vegetarian option)</h3>
            <h3>1/2 tsp salt</h3>
            <h3>1/2 tsp black pepper</h3>
            <h3>1/2 tsp garlic powder</h3>
            <h3>1/2 tsp onion powder</h3>

            <h3>For Assembling the Burger:</h3>
            <h3>4 burger buns</h3>
            <h3>4 slices of cheese (optional)</h3>
            <h3>Lettuce leaves</h3>
            <h3>Sliced tomatoes</h3>
            <h3>Sliced onions (optional)</h3>
            <h3>Pickles (optional)</h3>

            <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
            <h3>2 tbsp mayonnaise</h3>
            <h3>1 tbsp ketchup</h3>

        </div>
        <img src="images (2).jpeg" alt="img">
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Burger Patties</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce. If you're using an egg, add it as well for binding. Mix everything well and shape the mixture into 4 patties, ensuring they are slightly larger than the burger buns to account for shrinkage while cooking.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 2: Cook the Patties</h3>
            <p>Heat a grill or a skillet over medium heat. Place the patties on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side (or until they reach your desired doneness). If you're using cheese, add a slice of cheese to each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover the skillet to melt the cheese.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 3: Toast the Buns</h3>
            <p>While the patties are cooking, slice the burger buns in half and toast them lightly on the grill or in a skillet until they are golden brown.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
            <p>In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, and lemon juice (if using) until smooth. This will be your burger sauce.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Burger</h3>
            <p>Spread a generous amount of sauce on the bottom half of each toasted bun. Add a cooked patty, followed by lettuce leaves, a slice of tomato, onion slices, and pickles (if using). Top with the other half of the bun.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
            <p>Serve the burger immediately while it's still hot with your favorite sides (fries, chips, or a salad) and enjoy!</p>
        </div>
